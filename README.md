# My Portfolio 

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Maciej Malinowski, The Flutter Developer.
Via this app I want to share the most important of my Flutter skills.

# What can you find in this app?
At first page you need to log in via email and password.
technologies that I used: Firebase Auth, flutter_native_splash

Then you got Info Page with any contact information you would need. 
Also there is little text that uses localization with 2 lauguages polish and english.

Second page at botton navigation bar titeld EventPage is empty. 
In future there will be event planner.

Third page is Weather Page. Here you can type any city name to see temperature in there, thanks to API services. 
technologies that I used Dio,Rest_api

The last page at BNB are DatabasePage, there are values that comes from Firebase. That page also uses code generetors.
